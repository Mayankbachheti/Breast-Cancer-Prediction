Breast Cancer Prediction Model


üî¨ Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning model designed to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on diagnostic measurements. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in prediction to aid in early and reliable diagnosis. The model is developed using a logistic regression algorithm and standard data science libraries.

üèÜ Key Achievements & Performance

High Accuracy: The final model achieves an impressive 96% accuracy in classifying tumors, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness.

Data-Driven Classification: Successfully distinguishes between malignant and benign cases, providing a critical tool for medical diagnostics.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Pipeline
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned and prepared using Pandas and NumPy. This includes handling missing values and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are identified and selected to improve model performance and reduce complexity.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model from Scikit-learn is trained on the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluation: The model's performance is rigorously evaluated on a test set to validate its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
